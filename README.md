# Variation-Autoencoder with Cross Attention

This is just a personal project of mine where I create a Variational Autoencoder(VAE) that can be trained on just about any images conditioned on text prompts. After training, the VAE will generate images similar to the ones it was trained on. I plan on making this repository more usable for developers in the future, but for now I uploaded what I had to show how training a VAE using streamed data from huggingface could work.
